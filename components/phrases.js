        caption:"As Number Game tells, the talent you poses at any given point, is the summation of all the work, effort and time put into it. What Number Game does not tell you is that success is not exactly quantity based. To succeed at something often requires a great deal of luck, along with your talents.<br><br>With enough training, and honing, you can be great at whatever you want to be in. Some people might have a 'head start' due to some innate talent or how their brain is configured for such task. Someone's brain might be better suited for math, while the other may be better for playing the violin. However, with enough time given to each both, those small bumps in initial ability get smoothed out as practice, time and training over the long distance will trump any slight headstart.<br><br>For success however, you can <i>be</i> the greatest, the smartest, or have the most time sunk into any one thing, but that does not guarantee success. The best objective book ever written is probably not the most well known, the best pianist is probably not going on world tours and reinventing music, and the funniest person to ever live who can formulate the best jokes is probably some nobody we will never know of. Why is it like this? Luck. Those who are at the top, successful, and those most seen, they are lucky among other things. Not to say they don't have some innate talent, or did not work hard to get where they are, but being a success, does not always mean that person is the best at what they are successful at. On the flip side, the best person is not always in the position that successful person is, regardless if their honed talent matches or exceeds them.<br><br>It comes down to luck. Try your best, apply yourself, and put in the time, and more than likely you will outshine those with less effort put in. But remember, no amount of time and greatness can guarantee success, as <u>all success is predicated on an uncertain future</u> that some people will just happen to play into, and other will happen to sway from.

Things are easier now and those worries I once had are a thing of the past. One day though, far from now, I'll be joined. Maybe by you, perhaps by someone familiar, or a complete stranger, but when that day comes there will be a lot of catching up to do. I'll show them around, they'll see what I've done with the place and in return, they'll tell me their life story, their wisdom, and talk of changes over there. We'll laugh, perhaps cry but that reunion, even if bitter-sweet, will have meant more than the world to me. More than I ever stole from the world.<br><br>My only regret, besides that searing sting, is not spending more time with you. Oh how I wish we had more time together. Perhaps if things were different, I could of spent a lifetime with you and in return you could have spent a lifetime with me. Perhaps in another life. Perhaps. Perhaps. Perhaps.<br><br> When my life became a dark empty void, you were a match. A source of warmth, guidance, and direction in an otherwise, cold, desolate, and permanent place.
